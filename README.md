# Introduction
üìä Dive into the UEFA Champions League player stats! This project analyzes ‚öΩ top-performing players, üèÜ key performance metrics, and üìà where standout skills align with exceptional on-field impact in the Champions League.


# Background
Driven by a quest to uncover the secrets of top performance in the UEFA Champions League, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint key skills and metrics that define elite players, streamlining insights for fans, coaches, and analysts to identify standout talents and game-changing performances.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. Which player has the highest number of assists?
2. What is the correlation between the number of dribbles and assists for players?
3. Which club has the highest total assists among its players?
4. How do assists vary by position? Are certain positions more likely to contribute assists?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **MySql Workbench:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

### 1. Which player has the highest number of assists?

```SELECT Player_name, 
       MAX(assists) AS highest_assists
FROM attacking
GROUP BY Player_name
ORDER BY highest_assists DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
### 2. What is the correlation between the number of dribbles and assists for players?

```SELECT AVG(dribbles) AS avg_dribbles, 
       AVG(assists) AS avg_assists,
       COUNT(*) AS n
FROM attacking;
```
### 3.Which club has the highest total assists among its players?

```SELECT club, 
       SUM(assists) AS total_assists
FROM attacking
GROUP BY club
ORDER BY total_assists DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### 4.How do assists vary by position? Are certain positions more likely to contribute assists?

```SELECT position, 
       SUM(assists) AS total_assists,
       COUNT(Player_name) AS player_count,
       AVG(assists) AS avg_assists_per_player
FROM attacking
GROUP BY position
ORDER BY total_assists DESC;
```
